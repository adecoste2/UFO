# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to organize and analyze a data.js file of UFO sighting data using JavaScript and Bootstrap and post the data online in a table that can be filtered by city, state, country, and shape or any combination of the aforementioned search filters.   

## Results:
The end user can easily look up UFO sighting data utilizing the filter search bars on the left side of the screen and pressing ‘enter’.

## Summary:
One of the main drawbacks of this online table is that it requires a data.js file with data. This can make the data stagnant. It would be my suggestion to implement web scraping so that the data being pulled into the table is current.
